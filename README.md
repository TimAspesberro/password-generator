# Password Generator

## Project Decription
This project was focused around adding javascript to the existing HTML and CSS to create a functional web application.
The finished project is supposed to be a random password generator which allows the user to select the number of characters 
as well as the types of characters. That includes special, numerical, uppercase and lowercase characters. After gathering 
that data from the user it will output the randomized password tailored to them.

## User Story

I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
